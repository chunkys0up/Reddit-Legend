I quite like the UI and the customizability of the Robinhood Legends website and wanted to experiment with something similar, but not on the same level as it.

This was my first time using react-grid-layout and reddit api so I don't have all the quirks down but a lot of the customizability was made easy to understand
through documenation.

React-grid-layout github: https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout

Prerequisites: Reddit api Client ID

To install:
- Tailwindcss
- react-grid-layout
- react-router-dom

- then npm install in the client to start
- npm run dev to run the program

No backend talking just straight frontend to api call.
